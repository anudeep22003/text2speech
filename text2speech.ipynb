      "Part 1: Emergence, Entropy and the UniverseEmergence is the phenomenon of properties of a system arising (or emerging) due to the interaction of parts in a wider whole. Think of these as abilities unlocked when large-scale network effects come into play. An example of this is consciousness. Today, we understand neurons pretty well, their structure, how they fire electrically and chemically, and how they connect to neighboring neurons. Despite this rich detail on a single neuron, we do not understand how consciousness emerges when 100 Billion of them interact in the structure we call a brain. An example more in our wheelhouse are computers. Transistors are miniaturized electric switches used to represent binary electronic switches, the most fundamental of them being AND, OR and NOT gates (see reference #1). NAND and NOR are universal gates because all other gates can be derived from them. From the absolute simplicity of a switch that has two states, \"0\" and \"1,\" emerged ways to store data, process it algorithmically and distribute it over large-scale networks of the internet. Recent advances have led to surreal applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Models that can discern language, drive autonomous vehicles, and help us stay in touch with people across the world. It can even go so far as to model two black holes crashing into each other (Two Black Holes Merge into One Reference #2). From binary logic gates thus emerged human wrought intelligence. There are other examples of emergence; 26 letters in the alphabet creating an infinitely extendable communication medium we call language. The four basic compounds called base pairs (abbreviated as A, G, C, and T) interlock in different combinations to form the double helix of DNA. From that aperiodic crystal emerges the complexity of life (base pairs of DNA Reference #3). The four base pairs of the DNA encode 20 amino acids that combine to form inter and intra cellular machinery we broadly call proteins. A cascade of firing neurons leads to thought. There are many more examples of emergence, where deceptive simplicity leads to unfathomable complexity. The universe too, in all its complexity, emerged from the interaction of elementary particles constrained by fundamental universal laws. Theory of General Relativity is an example of such a law. One of the most fundamental of such laws is the one concerning entropy, which simplified states that the amount of disorder in a closed system always increases. Entropy is incredibly fundamental to the universe, with Einstein once remarking that 1000 years from now, our species may discover new laws that overwrite current ones but not the second law of thermodynamics. Stated more generally, the second law of thermodynamics states that the universe is inevitably heading towards states of higher disorder i.e. higher entropy.(In this essay, the terms entropy and disorder are used interchangeably. Higher entropy and higher disorder mean the same thing.) Let's take a slight detour to understand entropy, because of how fundamental it is to the universe, and as we will see to life and the mind. Entropy is a statistical representation of disorder. To explain this, let's take 100 standard coins with Heads and Tails and toss all of them at the same time and record their configuration when they fall. The sample of possible states is every possibility between (100H, 0T) to (0H,100T) with the middle case being (50H, 50T). Since each coin can be either an H (head) or a T (tail), i.e 2 possible configurations and there are 100 coins, so the total number of possible configurations (including repeats) is 2^100.  \n",

      "The above picture which maps out the probability space of 3 coins hopefully gives you an intuition on how quickly the complexity grows.Let's just take a pause and wrap our head around this number 2^100, which is 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376. This is a massive massive number. To put it into better context, imagine you have a standard paper that you fold into half, then you continue folding the same paper in half again for a total of 100 times. How thick would the resulting paper stack be? The answer, a mind-bending 13.7 Billion Light years, that is to the edge of the observable universe (see how this is so here reference #4). Fun fact, 42 folds of the paper gets you to the moon. Only 58 more gets you to the edge of the observable universe, which is unreal. A human brain does not easily grasp exponential growth, watch this (provocatively titled) video to build an intuition \"The most important video you will ever see. (reference #5)\"Coming back to our experiment, of the total 2^100 possible outcomes, only one branch in the outcome space corresponds to 100H, 0T. Similarly, only one outcome corresponds to 0H, 100T. Hence the probability of such an event randomly occurring is 0.000000000000000000000000000000788 (7.88e-31) which is infinitesimally small. This is the most ordered state, and per the 2nd law, the configuration of the universe of these particles will tend to higher disorder, ultimately converging around the most probable of all outcomes 50H, 50T. You would be very surprised if while doing these random tosses you see an outcome of 100H, 0T or 0H, 100T, but you would hardly bat an eyelid if some configuration around 50H, 50T showed up. Your brain intuitively grasps the improbability of highly ordered configurations. Ordered configurations in fact are energy-rich, because building order takes energy, and breaking that order yields energy. In the above example, if you landed with a 100H, 0T configuration, that is the most energy-rich configuration of those particles, and as you extract energy to do other things the configuration will progressively tend towards 50H, 50T, the least energy configuration. So in a simplistic essence, order is correlated to energy. How did order even emerge then if disorder is significantly more probably, and how do you explain stars giving off massive amounts of energy? This is a fair question and one that physics helps answer. Without going too much into detail, when the Big Bang happened, fundamental particles exploded from a compressed, incredibly dense core and flew out from which particle clumps started to form. When some of these clumps reached a critical mass, they started exerting gravitational pull and started pulling other particles towards themselves thus transforming dispersed gaseous giants into stars. Stars have a highly ordered core, tightly packed elemental fuel sources that are being fused together due to the intense pressure of gravity. But the further away from the core you go the more disordered the particles are, such that the 2nd law of thermodynamics still holds. The entropy decrease in the core is more than sufficiently balanced by an increase in the entropy towards the outer edge of the star. The sun too, if you observe, has a solar atmosphere at the edge that becomes visible during a total solar eclipse, which is the high entropy part of the star (The Sun's Atmosphere - reference #6). Many years later (~4 Billion years) and a rollercoaster journey, the sun will burn out and settle into being a dead star, entropically equivalent to a 50H, 50T state. Part 2: Entropy and Evolution, two sides of the same coinWhat explains the emergence of life then? Life emerged from evolution, but why was evolution even allowed to occur? This is where things start transferring from the metaphysical to the personal. Human beings are a byproduct of evolution; we are highly ordered cellular structures and we are blessed with the ability to reverse local entropies to our benefit. The phone you hold, the laptop I am typing this on, a chair, and almost everything we have invented is an ordered structure. Do we break the 2nd law of thermodynamics? No, nothing breaks the 2nd law and as we will see, life favors entropy's thirst for disorder. So much so, that is willing to let order some order emerge so long as the net disorder is always on the rise. Evolution is in some sense the twin of entropy, the yin to its yang, the heads to its tail. Entropy allows for evolution to occur, in fact, encourages it. Ordered life forms emerge because the universe wants to reach its entropic potential. In slightly more lay terms, you know when you say that kid has great potential but they did not apply themselves and hence squandered their gifts away? Or that other kid who worked really hard to achieve their full potential, and then did. The universe is kind of like a kid with the potential to do great things, but the universe has to work hard to achieve its full potential. Potential here is analogous to change in entropy, literally how much entropy changed. If the universe stayed in the same configuration that the \"Big Bang\" wrought about, over vast swathes of time (10^100 years) the energy would eventually decompose but short of star or other mega-structure collisions, entropy doesn't change too much. Entropic potential is achieved, when the energy in existing ordered systems is leveraged to impose order on unordered (random) configurations of particles. Since we know ultimately everything tends to disorder, these newly minted ordered structures too will dissipate into disorder. Additionally, to create a certain amount of order in the universe, you need to expend more order (energy) than you are creating to satisfy the 2nd law. Thus the net entropic change increases, and the universe moves closer to achieving its entropic potential. In a sense, the universe is trying to maximize it's entropic change.Of all the processes that could enable a universe to achieve its full entropic potential, few work as consistently well as evolution, maybe only beat by evolution's own progeny, an intelligent and conscious species. How does evolution help? Evolution is a process that is enabled by the existence of favorable conditions, the most important ones being - the presence of water in liquid form, a specific temperature range, gravity to prevent the atmosphere from escaping into space which creates a greenhouse effect leading to warmer conditions and thus leads to a cascade of favorable conditions for evolution to start. These conditions are so ubiquitous in our understanding of life that we look for habitable planets using similar metrics (see reference #7 Goldilocks zone). The existence of these conditions (a statistical anomaly by themselves) and the presence of carbon and select heavy elements in the earth's core lead to particle interactions, leading to agglomerations with a curious property - their motion cannot be explained by the laws of physics, they seemed to be able to move non-randomly. This ability to non-randomly move and exert control over their own agglomerations is a characteristic feature of life. The earliest agglomerations were single-cell organisms that didn't move much (if at all) but were indirectly responsible for all of life as we know it. These early agglomerations we call cyanobacteria used sunlight to fix the carbon dioxide dissolved in water and released Oxygen (O2) into the atmosphere (reference #8 Cyanobacteria and the Formation of Oxygen). Through a slow process that took billions of years, these ordered agglomerations leveraged the energy in sunlight and through complex metabolic pathways, make for themselves \"food.\" Food is a colloquial term for energy, which a living thing needs to sustain its ordered structure. The need for food to survive is the second core characteristic of living things. (Sidenote: If what cyanobacteria do sounds like what plants do, then you are prescient because cyanobacteria form the basis for photosynthesis. In the tree of evolution, photosynthesis was invented only once, every other organism that uses it has cyanobacteria to thank.)Let's take a moment to see how entropy likes all of this. Even the simplest organism has an ordered core (the body) that is low in entropy but needs to consume energy. This energy is obtained by converting low entropy structures to high entropy, which releases energy, that is consumed as food to maintain its low entropy state (reference #9 Entropy and Biology Photosynthesis). In photosynthesis specifically, cyanobacteria are able to take advantage of the sun raining down energy that is perennially being produced in adherence to the 2nd law. Evolution by virtue of its ability to create ordered life forms, is appeasing entropy's endless thirst by utilizing order but compensating the universe with a much higher increase in disorder. This oxygen-rich environment (first oceans and then the atmosphere) was critical to support the next level of complexity in life. The tree of life started bearing the fruit of complex multi-cellular organisms, one of those fruits being the human species. With an increase in cellular complexity, came an increase in energy requirements, which we have established come from ordered configurations. So evolution started imparting species with means to recognize these ordered configurations because it was critical to survival. These newly minted configurations endowed by evolution were responsible for enabling living things to identify energy-rich sources (food), and to chart a path towards these sources. These new structures have names themselves \"brains.\" Part 3: The emergence and evolution of brainsThe most ordered structures out there to consume were, unsurprisingly, other life forms. Identifying life is not an easy classification to make. Today, we have a good sense of what is edible and what isn't, but when the first organisms were starting out, they needed to be able to differentiate between life and non-life, to classify as edible or not. Let us stop to ponder the complexity of this question, how, without taking for granted hindsight, would a biological brain have been able to differentiate between things that live and those that didn't? Entropy again, I argue, provides the foundation for that answer. Entropy is a descent into disorder, and as we covered before, an increase in entropy is a fundamental truth about the universe. (In fact, an accepted theory of time is that time IS the direction of entropy increase.) If everything is tending to disorder, then change to disorder is a constant, whereas life is a structure that maintains its order. In scenes observable to life forms, disorder tends to emerge from the interaction of particular configurations with the environment. The brain against a backdrop of disorder, keeps track of life as the structures that has a few common properties - their structures don't disintegrate into disorder, and the particles seem to be able to engage in self-directed motion. Structures that fit this bill maintain their entropic state, through configurations that persist despite interaction to atmosphere, and they seem to move non-randomly. Dead life, on the other hand, has the entropic configuration of life, but is losing its entropy quickly, decomposing to interaction with the environment, and is also incapable of self-directed motion. Thus as an early step, brains evolved an ability to classify. Classification is the ability to distinguish an object from its background and identify the characteristics that demarcate it as such. Or in other words, in the vast web of complexity that comes from particles interacting with each other, classification is the ability to isolate particular configurations, based on common sub-particular configurations that we call properties. As an example: We can use the general properties of living things classify a chimpanzee, a fish and a human as living things. But because we are able to distinguish properties, we realize that a human and a chimp are more similar because they live on land, and the sub-configuration of their limbs reveals a common architecture of two hind and two fore-limbs used for moving the body.Brains, however did not evolve in isolation. Most complex multicellular species evolved brains and in order to preserve themself, they realized that not only do they need to identify entropy to consume as food, but also realized themselves as a source of such energy to animals higher up on the food chain. Evolution selected for brain characteristics that additionally optimized for self-preservation. Now not only did brains need to mobilize bodies to chart a path in three-dimensional space towards energy, but now towards moving targets, food sources actively trying to preserve their own lives, cognizant of an approaching predator. This is incredibly complex when you stop to think about it, and huge complexity gains in the brain were needed to be made to support these battles of \"eat, be eaten.\" (This may have been the first time differential calculus was unconsciously applied to close a gap, and integral calculus to anticipate the gap close and increase their chances of survival). This finds resonance in the human world too, incredible technological strides were made during battle. In fact in Guns, Germs and Steel, a seminal book, it was argued that Europe was able to progress technologically rapidly because of nations sharing borders on all sides resulting in constant skirmishes. Battles have evolutionarily sharpened our brains, and we see the resonance of that in our anthropomorphic history. However, brains were not the only way to gain an evolutionary advantage in the hunt for food. Size and strength, became important evolutionary advantages. If an organism had the advantage of size (as in the case of dinosaurs, blue whales, sharks) or strength (as in case of lions, sharks, crocodiles) they didn't need to think too hard about getting their food. Their size gave them a vantage point that enabled them to look far, and their strength meant they could take down any food source without too much trouble. Essentially, size and strength put the organism higher up on the food chain, which reduced their survival risks. Hence, lacking in natural enemies, they did not need to breed aplenty to keep their numbers, nor did they need to become ever better-thinking machines. (Reference #10 Brain to Body Mass Ratio)Humans are at that size where they have several potential enemies that are larger and stronger than them, but not so small that they were in a constant cycle of \"be eaten.\" Human beings were a fairly reproductive species, as up until a few millennia ago, mortality rates of youth was quite high at 46.2% and so was infant mortality at 26.9% (Reference #11 Mortality Rates Of Children Over The Last Two Millennia), this meant the human species was a lot more genetically active than the other species higher up in the food chain. DNA is such that during the life of a species, information can only ever be translated from DNA to RNA to proteins, and never in the opposite direction (this is called the Central Dogma of Biology - Reference #12). This means that changes in DNA, which were the only way for a species to evolve, could only happen via more births. It is not possible for you to change your DNA during life and pass those changes to your offspring.  So humans were in a sweet spot, where they were sufficiently small to reproduce quickly enough that their genetic diversity was constantly changing in the early days and not so small that they were constantly under threat of extinction from having a natural enemy that marked them for food. In a sense, they were the \"upper middle class\" of the food chain, due to which they could as a species focus on self-actualizing pursuits like forming societies, growing their own food and inventing religion and nationhood to bind societies. I cannot help but notice how similar this is to Corona Virus, where it was only mildly deadly, but spread easily allowing it to genetically diversify. It too was the \"upper middle class\" of flu-like viruses.   Due to human's size disadvantage, they made up for it in massive gains in the capacity of their brain. With nearly 86 Billion neurons, we had more than we needed to just survive. Most of the brain of any organism is devoted to keeping its various life processes running. This, referred to as the subconscious, is what keeps you breathing, your immune system functioning, and your musculature able to control your body (to name a tiny subset of functions your brain performs). Certain functions like the heart beating is (interestingly) brain independent and is carried about by a specific type of muscle that is unique to your heart called myocardium (Reference #13 Cardiac Conduction). Most organism's brain capacity asymptotes at the point that it is able to carry out all these base functions and keep an organism alive and propagate its species. Hence most (if not all) species are highly \"present,\" which means they live in the moment. So if they get hungry: their brain figures out a path to fulfilling that need; they reach sexual maturity: then their brain figures out a path to reproducing; they sense a threat from a predator: then the brain figures out a way to save itself. This is why dogs are so sad to see you leave, and so happy when you come back. They don't have a consistent sense of time elapsed, so when you leave, unless habituated, they have no idea when or if you are coming back. Once the base processes were accounted for, the excess capacity of the brain is, for an evolutionarily first time, available for \"luxury\" purposes. Luxuries that led to superpowers like the ability to sense the passage of time, the twin miracle of speech and language, and perhaps the most powerful of them all - reflection. Our ability to reflect on our thoughts (also called metacognition) is, I would argue, at the center of most of the technical progress we have made as individuals and as a society. It is that last superpower that is our window into entropy, and by extension our theoretical peephole allowing a glimpse into the fabric of the universe through such mental concoctions like quantum physics, string theory and general relativity.  Reflection is also what allows us to observe and deconstruct our own biology. Part 4: Brains as a reflection of the universeOur discussion of entropy touched on how the order of stars came to form from the \"Big Bang\" while respecting the 2nd law of thermodynamics (entropy always increases). Stars are enormous, mind-bendingly large hearths that not only transmit light and heat in the form of radiation that enables photosynthesis and thus life, but equally importantly, also act as a massive forge to combine the simplest element of Hydrogen into complex elements all the way up to Nickel.  (The stars are the crucible that combines the basic emergent element of Hydrogen (1p (proton) and 1e (electron)) into more complex compounds, starting with Helium (2p, 2n (neutrons) and 2e) and going all the way to produce Nickel (28p, 28n, 28e). Starting from the time of the Greek in the west, we used to think of atoms as the smallest unit, indivisibility conferred to it in its name. We have later come to understand that, atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons. We now know even those have more fundamental constituents called quarks. The universe at this layer of abstraction is made of electrons and quarks; quarks constitute protons and neutrons (a proton and neutron can transform into the other). (Sidenote: String theory is an even deeper layer of abstraction that posits that the most fundamental particles are not quarks and electrons, but actually infinitesimal strings in extremely high tension that generate all the subatomic particles and forces of the world through string vibrations)So the universe started off as an agglomeration of electrons and quarks (also photons); quark agglomerations manifest as protons and neutrons; proton, electron, and neutron agglomerations manifest as atoms, atom agglomerations manifest as molecules, and carbon-based molecular agglomerations manifest as the molecular machinery that we call proteins, and proteins manifest life. At every step of the way, particles associate into larger structures, obeying the rules that inform their mutual interaction. But at every stage, what emerges is fantastically different from what came before it. We have almost no hope of predicting an emergent property.  If you try to visualize a simplified universe, with only 25 atoms (that formed from prior quark, electron agglomerations that we will ignore for simplicity) and 4 types of atoms that agglomerate into molecules. These molecules then combine amongst each other to form proteins, and proteins combine with an energy source in the form of a molecule, and together in our simple 4 atom universe, they are the simplest life forms.------------------ A simple 25 atom universe ------------------  \n",

      "Is it not remarkable how analogous to one another the universe and the brain are? The brain is quite literally a reflection of the universe, and maybe that is how we perceive the universe indirectly, first through the senses and then by recreating it in our brain. While most animals do the same, what makes us different is that a part of our brain is sectioned off to store a core pattern, our pattern of self. I talk more about it in another essay but the core idea is that our identity comes from a set of memories and influences that shaped the brain. Memories are but a reflection of a slice of the universe that we call our environment. In recognition of the importance of these memories it stores them separately and ties them together into a super pattern. Since our brain loves telling stories (the story of the universe for example) these memories and influences when linked together lead to the emergence of a central story. This is the story that defines our sense of \"self.\" Since any memory is of the real world, and the only thing that is capable of interacting with the real world is not our brain but our body, our bodily perception are a critical part of our \"self.\"  Our sense of self is the part of our brain held invariant, that is able to experience, witness, and influence the other parts that change and are free to change.Part 5: The brain, language and entropyThis brings us to language, one of the most beautiful inventions of the human mind. It is impossible to know the origins of language because language originated as far as we can tell in the human mind alone. Our records of what we can loosely call language started off as cave paintings, followed by hieroglyphics and many intermediate forms before formal writing came along. Some writing survived the ravages of time and helped us piece together a history of language's emergence. The word emergence is important here, and it is a reinforcement of a pattern we talked at the very start of this essay, a property of a system arising from the interaction of parts in a wider whole. Here the interactants are human brains, and the emergent property of the network of brains is language. While we can never be sure of language's exact story of emergence because of it's inverse nature (Reference #14 Inverse Problem) we can piece together a story by studying its effects. We know that there is overlap in the areas of the brain responsible for language and action (motor) area (Reference #15 Brain Mechanisms Linking Language and Action). This helps identify a causal relationship between the two, with hand gestures like grasping having come first followed by a linguistic representation of that gesture. Are animated gestures when speaking are a resonance of the overlap. How do humans converge towards a particular gesture or a word that denotes it given the infinite variations that are possible? This is where network effects come in. Since language of one i.e. a language that only you understand is not very useful in communication, there needs to be a wider consensus. This is naturally achieved in societies through the wisdom of crowds, which comes close to optimal solutions. Let me give you an example to expand on this. In grad school our behavioral economics professor showed our class of ~60 students a picture of a big cow, and asked us to guess it's weight. We had no additional information beyond that picture, and we were all to write our answers on a piece of paper and pass it along to the TA who collected and tallied it. What came out was memorable enough that I remember it to this day many years later. When tallied the answers had a wide range, with comically low and absurdly high guesses, but curiously, when averaged out, the final answer was remarkably close to the actual weight of the cow, within ~2% of the actual. This is not a one-off result but rather repeatable, where every class before us that the professor had conducted this experiment on were within ~5% of the actual weight. This is the underlying principle behind democracies; if the people are informed and free to independently choose they are likely to arrive at the most optimal candidate.Even in lab experiments where people were asked to choose gestures for a particular set of words without speaking, first individually and then collaboratively, in a matter of 10 group iterations, the gestures for the words came out to be consistent both within and across subjects (Reference #16 Evolving artificial sign languages in the lab). You can think of language as having emerged from many such iterations where the initial gestures and sounds to denote a particular action was random but through every brain it inhabited, language was refined and grew closer to the most ordered representation of sounds stringed together to represent something in the real world. The birth and death of languages (put picture of language tree here), helped more refined and finer grain order to emerge. ------------------ A Language Tree - credit SSSScomic  ------------------  \n",

      "This is not to say that language is all structured, in fact, most of our word choices are completely arbitrary. Why the word banana for the fruit vs any other combination of sounds? It is likely somebody must have come up with it, the word slowly became popular with others and after a critical mass of people started using it, the group collectively agreed. In today's time, dictionary companies perform this function by accepting new words into the language every year. However, what collectively came out was a common syntactical structure to language lacking which we wouldn't be able to understand it uniformly. Our understanding is also helped along by fixed words like pronouns (he, she, they, I, you, etc) and determiners (the, a, an, etc). These parts of language don't change every year, they are largely invariant. You can maybe start seeing the similarity between evolution and language, where language is the emergence of information from symbols. A natural question to ask then is what is information?Part 5.1: Information, association and entropyWhile it may sound tautological, information is the ordered configuration of symbols that refers to entropy in the universe, or, more specifically, the aspects of the universe that reduces \"referential entropy\" or \"interaction entropy.\" These are new terms and let me explain what I mean. Referential entropy is the name given to associations in the entropic space like we discussed previously. Association of quarks and electrons are called atoms, associations of atoms are called molecules, some associations of carbon-based molecules are called life and so also is a chair an association of particles where we can comfortably sit on and lean our back on. Interaction entropy is the name given to change, the changes that caused a \"referential entropy\" to move in spacetime or to change it's agglomeration structure. This is difficult to easily explain (probably because I too am not very clear) but think of it as the name given to the links that lead to particle agglomerations to change their location, or their configuration. Verbs for example represent interaction entropy, where move, push, walk, or breathe represent changes to locations of agglomerations. Words like force, gravity, heat are a quantitative measure of the interaction entropy because they are able to explain how particles will interact without waiting for the interaction to play out. When something is decomposed, built on or torn down (at the atomic, and higher levels of agglomeration) is a form of interaction entropy that leads to new referential entropy.------------------ Referential and Interaction Entropy  ------------------  \n",

      "I gave this somewhat involved explanation to arrive at the point that information is the notation given to the order in the disorder (or entropy) of the universe. The law of gravity is incredible because it has the capacity to take almost any slice of the universe with objects of referential entropy (planets, stars, space shuttles, and every particle agglomeration past a certain size) and predict its entropic interaction, i.e the interaction entropy. In fact we have a mathematical law that reveals a fundamental force that is able to hold its own against entropy. Similarly relativity is magnificent because it was able to identify a bound to the universe, that the speed of any object with referential entropy cannot exceed the speed of light, which is an interaction entropy. It was essentially able to prune the tree of the universe by invalidating a set of interaction entropies, the entropy achieved of particles moving at speeds greater than the speed of light. By reducing the entropic space of possibilities, Einstein was able to follow other branches and realize the curving of space. I do not mean to trivialize the achievements of Einstein in discovering this. To be able to model the universe and it's entropy on such a titanic scale and derive the central order from all of it is unparalleled in its creativity and cognition, something only a human brain could do since it is the reflection of the universe. It makes sense now why language is so difficult for computers to understand because when we speak a sentence, every word plays a part in progressively reducing the entropic space of the universe in focus. We also call this attention. Language is also inherently recursive, we can write a sentence and then in the middle of the sentence choose to add detail about a specific part, kind of like I did with this fragment right now. The recursivity of language is an important feature, because it allows us to use language to talk about language. It is an excellent reflection of consciousness, central to which is our ability as a thinking being to look inward and reflect on our own thought. No wonder humans were the ones to come up with language, our brain reflected itself out into the real world in the form of language. Part 5.2: An aggregation of abstract entropyThis is an interesting avenue lets dig a little deeper by considering a trivial example. Take the example of the word \"chair\" and its conventional definition of being a place we can park our buttocks on and rest our backs. We associate it with comfort because we transferred the work our body was doing to keep itself upright into the external world, thus saving energy expenditure that kept our muscles contracted. We recognize a wide spectrum of chairs, from human-engineered ones to flat rocks in specific formations that afford us the comfort of resting our muscles and leaning our back. This is a different form of referential entropy (or particular agglomeration), because there is no inherent uniformity. Up until now when we considered objects as having referential entropy, we were looking at increasing levels of associations, where atoms associated to form molecules, molecules to proteins, and proteins to life. The similarity is much higher than in what we refer to as a chair. A chair could be made of wood, steel, rocks, branches and so many other things and it still fits our loose definition of a chair. How then is our brain associating such diversity into a single definition? This is where the body comes in. Our brain inherited the capacity to form associations from the universe but then we made it our own. We are not constrained to form associations only of the type that the universe most commonly experienced. We experience the universe through our body, and the experiences received through the sensory inputs of the body are a rich source of potential associations. When Descartes formulated his theory of the mind, he proposed a dualist theory - one where the brain and body are separate, with the body being a sort of homunculus, dumb and stupid on its own but elevated when animated by the mind. (Dualism by Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Reference #17) The mind was the center of consciousness, the body a necessary appendage to host it. From this rather bacterial definition of life, we have philosophically evolved to a different model where the brain and the body are not separate but a single entity, neither meaningful without the other. This theory called materialism dispenses of the special treatment given to the brain and instead argues that there is no mind, only a body. Genes express and neurons fire in the body, and through that we receive and inhabit the universe. Our brain housed safely in our skull, is for all intents and purposes blind to the universe. It only receives it through the senses, then reconstructs it into a simulation and inhabits it. Our body, on the other hand, actually inhabits the world and thus plays a critical role in shaping language. The wide diversity in the agglomeration of particles being called a chair is because the body sees its importance in its interaction with it. So the referential entropy of the body, has an interaction entropy of sitting on a wide variety of objects that are entropically quite different but have perceived attributes of importance. Here the attributes are of comfort to the muscles in the body, specifically your leg and back muscles. Perceived attributes are quite important too, they have no entropic significance except that they are a set of abstract attributes that are important to the object that is interacting with it. The beauty is that if the object was lifeless, no perceived attribute would exist and what you see is what you get. However, since life is self mobilizing, and endowed with the ability to act independently (through the consumption of energy) it gets to find its own meaning, or stated more generally, attribute whatever importance it wants to. Since we are still, ultimately, pattern recognition engines, we don't attribute one-off qualities (or qualia) but rather, we converge on attributes that hold common importance. This is an extension of the consensus and the wisdom of crowds' idea, where the attributes that are important evolve from the survival of fittest playing on attributes. These most-fit attributes then associate together into objects of abstract referential entropy. This type of referential entropy is different from what we previously discussed because particles are not actually agglomerating, rather they are agglomerating into mental structures in the mind, vetted by social and cultural standards. This idea of an abstract attribute that is only important to us humans also doesn't stop there, as would not surprise you it also agglomerates into higher-level associations. This is different from referential entropy because no actual particles are involved, rather it is a coagulation of attributes. For eg: the word home, is a non-exhaustive combination of attributes of security, comfort, shelter, privacy and safety (most of which are abstract attributes themselves).  Another category of words are those of physiological needs and emotions, which sometimes go hand in hand. The feeling of hunger, thirst, doubt, sadness, anger, frustration and jealousy (to name a few) are very important to us and come from the interplay of the body and the mind. Physiological needs like thirst and hunger are a body communicating its needs, while words like comfort and safety are a body's response to the attributes of the part of the universe their body inhabits (what we also call environment). Emotions are very interesting in this context, because they are the seat of so many things that makes humans creative, thoughtful and reflecting beings. We discussed in an earlier part that our ability to reflect is one of our most powerful abilities and separates us from most of the living kingdom. We established that we perceive the world through our senses and then recreate the senses into a representation of the universe, or what we call reality, and the brain perceives us inhabiting it. Thus we rarely receive the universe as is, we color it with our biases borne from our memories and other facets of our \"selves\" that were impressed upon us by the very universe we live in. So we simulate the universe as a personal reality and inhabit it. All of us thus inhabit our own slightly different realities, which is why our languages are slightly different but close enough that we can communicate. We will use the word \"truth\" to refer to the uncolored universe, which I don't even know is possible to mentally receive. We need a control function then to keep our reality simulation in check, otherwise what is to stop us from creating fantastical universes, completely different from anything remotely real and inhabiting it. We associate this with mental disease, a child who thinks they have superpowers and can fly, and attempts to jump off the roof. This clearly is very dangerous and needs evolutionary protection. I propose that emotions evolved as this control function on universal simulation. Sadness is when our simulation of a universe fails the reality test, and happiness is when it passes the test. Thus, sadness is the simulation of a universe with referential and interaction entropy that is rejected by reality, while happiness in a sense is one that is accepted by reality. Trust is the interaction entropy between two \"selves\" that has over time proved itself to fit each other's simulation, while distrust is when reality has taught you of the failure of your prediction. Jealousy is when the autobiographical simulation of your universe is superseded by the reality of somebody else's. Humour is a unique interpretation of the laws that lead to a simulation of a universe that is for all intents and purposes possible but either knowingly impossible, or only remotely possible, or plays up an abstract attribute. Many times humor involves a shared, almost telepathically communicated new parallel universal configuration with changed parameters that enable the impossible, like talking animals or the personification of inanimate entities. However, humor hits hardest not when it is completely nonsensical but sensible per the laws of the parallel universe that was mutually agreed to in the shared consciousness of the humans participating in the humorous experience.Part 6: Free will and our ability to shape realityThe universe plays itself out probabilistically, where no particular pathway in the entropic space of possibilities is favored, but is a cascade of probabilities. For the current world to have the form and structure we see, every past event had to happen in the exact order that it did, and every living thing in it had to behave exactly as it did. The slightest variation has the potential to create a substantially different universe that we may not recognize. This steps into the arenas of philosophers who use the inevitability as an argument against free will. If everything that happened had to happen for the current reality to manifest, then are we but biological machines playing our fixed roles in the entropic canvas of the universe? Doesn't this presuppose the existence of a god or a higher entity that carved out our roles, or is it just that this entity set in motion the first few cascades, and all of reality is a follow-through of that cascade? I will argue that we do have free will, but it is a choice we have to intentionally exercise. I will also argue that free will that can shape reality is a function of aggregating (or agglomerating) probabilities. Simple animals without the ability to execute complex coordination do not have the weight to pull off large-scale changes. This is not to say that they can have no impact. If a pack of wolves hunted every rabbit in their area and if hypothetically the rabits only existed in that one area, then given enough time the wolves would have whittled down the population of rabits to a sparsity that they are unable to find each other to reproduce. In effect, this pack of wolves drove a species to extinction. This is not dissimilar to what human poachers do, driving the populations of elephants to near extinction. Human beings when they are born spend almost 18 years in development before they are considered capable enough to become independent adults. During this time of development, the brain is shaped by the immediate environment. We are born with near blank slate brains but equipped with incredible neuroplasticity to drink in our surroundings and start modeling it in the brain. Our parents, our upbringing, our friends, and later, the society, all play a significant role in how we turn out. Each one of them fills us up with their own biases, and their idiosyncratic way of modeling their universe. Our brain has incredible machinery to distinguish features of the universe. We talked about our ability to classify in an earlier section, and this ability is something all of us are born with. However, we can only work with what we have been fed. So our universal simulation is an aggregate of the universal simulation of the people who influence us (with different weights). If we continue in this state, then we exit the interstate of universal possibility and step into a cul de sac of our a social simulation. We slowly lose our ability to exercise free will. However there is a way out, and that is to feed the brain with experience, or what I pedantically call new slices of the universe that the brain could not simulate by itself. We use various language analogies to describe this, including to \"broaden one's horizons\" and \"expand one's worldview.\" This is why a child who grew up in a rural village in India, who only went to school in the village and was taught by the same teachers that went to the school a decade ago, will rarely make life choices outside the norm of that village. However, a child who constantly experiences new cultures, is surrounded by diversity in a bustling metro, spends time in a culture diametrically opposed to his, or is bilingual (since we made the connection between language and universe simulation) is able to calculate probabilities on a much wider scale. The neurons calculate probabilities in the universe that the brain as a whole is able to simulate. So a child in the rural village can imagine the possibility of starting a company and becoming rich, but the neurons calculate that probability to be zero since it has never encountered that happening. Whereas the simple act of doing can expand your horizons. The experience of doing something that your brain firmly decided was not possible for you, but due to circumstances or \"will power\" you powered through and emerge unscathed on the other side is powerful. The brain learns to place less emphasis on its own simulations and realizes that a lot more is possible. As an example say you did not think you were capable of learning to program, but due to being laid off you were forced to pick it up and a few months later you end up with a programming job that you are much happier at. Now the brain realizes that a lot more is possible than you thought and the next time you have a very low probabilistic thought, like starting your company, your brain doesn't automatically shut it down as impossible.The brain is specific about the types of experiences that can change it, almost always an active experience is required, rarely if ever does passive experience have the same impact. Watching a documentary about somebody building a robot vs you actually building the robot has a huge variance in the impact to the brain. Watching a series about a group of friends in New York City, is very different than actually living in New York City and having friends, no matter how many times you watch it. Knowledge is another way that the brain expands its space of probability. A physicist who understand how the big bang happened, and how quarks and electrons that originated there interact amongst themselves to form planets and solar systems and life, is able to model much larger scales of the universe. A biologist who is witness to the incredibly subtle symphony of molecules and compounds that lead to life is able to model the universe in incredible depth. Having knowledge thus increases the simulated space of your universe in both breadth and depth, and thus increases the scope of possibilities that you assign. You now get to exercise free will, because no longer are you bound by the probability space that you were endowed through your environment. You get to exercise the characteristic feature of life, non-random motion not just in physical space but in entropic space. Which path you chose is a function of your emotions which place a personal value on different paths, and you choose the one that is most meaningful to you.Now that we understand how individuals gain free will, how is reality affected by individuals exercising their free will? Here again, the concept of aggregation and associations play a central role. While a single individual exercising their free will does not affect reality. However, when a path in entropic space is seen as valuable by others and people gather to support this individual or organize themselves to act as allies or as employees, then the free will of a single ambitious and audacious individual can change the course of the reality. In fact that is probably the only thing that can lead to changes in human timescales. Our objective reality is like a rope made of fibers of all of our individual realities such that through wisdom of crowds, the biases are stripped and only the real parts persist. A small set of people usually act as stewards of reality, and choose which direction humanity as a whole heads towards. We have had luminaries like Socrates, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, Fourier, Euler, Einstein, Schrodinger, Nietszche, Krishnamoorthy, Bohm, and in modern times Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. We have also had people like Hitler and Stalin do the same.  We need more people to step up to the role of stewards of humanity. However for that to happen more people need to think outside selfish scales and start imagining on the scale of humanity. For this to happen, you need people who seek diversity, and knowledge and realize that they are a manifestation of a universal consciousness and that their duty lies towards all of humanity and all of nature. ---- Thank you for reading ----Appendix:Association neuron analogy: Another reason association neurons emerged is to support more complex functions in animals, like movement as an example. To do something as simple as putting a leg in front of another to take a step involves effecting many neurons that allow fine-grain control over the individual muscles to maintain balance and coordination. If the brain had to individually compute contractions of every single muscle fibre, it would take massive computing capacity to do the simplest things. Association neurons help increase computational efficiencies by connecting up groups of nearby muscle fibers into an association neuron. Now to move a leg, you activate the respective association neuron and it will automatically activate the muscle fiber groups that it connects to. (see appendix for a good analogy)Let's take the example of a marionette to drive home this point. If you start off with a simple marionette with 3 strings to control it, this is fairly doable and within the limit of the digits on your hand. As you keep increasing the number of strings, the complexity of managing the marionette increases. With training, you can manage 10, with one string per digit using both your hands. Now imagine the marionette evolved in complexity, and grew to 100 strings. Due to the increase in the number of strings, the marionette acquires more exact and precise movements, but there is no way you can handle 100 strings. You don't have the required number of digits. The only way to still work the marionette is to group strings and reduce the number to a max of 10. Grouping the strings that work the hand of the marionette will lead to much smoother animation of the marionette, than say grouping some of the hand strings, some of the leg and some of the head together. However, these groups can then form a supergroup that is involved in a coordinated movement like walking the marionette, an act that involves the hands, the legs, and the neck. Reference: \n",
